\subsection{Quiz Print View}
\subsubsection{Problem Statement}
	Generate a printable view of quiz with or without answers

\subsubsection{Why Do we need this?}
	Many times its necessary to discuss the questions with the students after the quiz along with the correct answers. There wasn't a simple view which showed all the questions along with their answers in a simple format. Also for some quizzes there were students who wanted to take the quiz offline. A printable page with just the questions would allow the instructor to conduct the quiz using the app and offline simultaneously.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
	Displaying of question has two parts - the question text and the answers. Getting the Question text is straight forward and is directly obtained from the database field. Answers depends on the type of question

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integer question - Directly print the answer
	    \item Single and multiple answer question - Print the options and put a tick symbol on the answer
	    \item Fill in the blanks question - List all possible answers separated by comma
	    \item Floating point type question - Print the possible range of answers in the form of <lower bound> to <upper bound>
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reason texts list page}
\subsubsection{Problem Statement}

This is userful in many cases where the students needs to be evaluated for his methodoloty of solving the problem or reasoning. Displaying a list of all the reasons texts given by the students along with the Quiz Statistics feature 4allows to instructor to know how and why the students chose a particular answer.
