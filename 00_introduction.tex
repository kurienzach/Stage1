Technology can be used as an aid in improving the quality of education. SAFE can be used to conduct auto-graded, cheating-free exam in a proctored class room setting. This allows the instructor to immediately assess if the students have understood the content.

The current version of SAFE which is being used was created as a proof of concept and later expanded to include the feature requests of the users. But as more people started using SAFE it became evident that a complete rewrite of the App is required to make the code improve performance, scalable and maintainable. The major focus of the Stage 1 project is to implement any critical feature requests / bug fixes in the old version of the App and to stabilize and complete the coding of the new version.
