\section{Quiz Upload / Download From XML File} 
\hspace{0.5cm} 


\subsection{Problem Statement}
	Instructor should be able to Upload / Download quiz as XML file

\subsection{Why do we need this?}
	Even though SAFE provides an intuitive UI to create and edit quiz, sometimes instructors will have a template of their quiz and would like to use it as a starting point. Using an xml file as the template instructors can upload the template and then use the UI to make edits in the quiz.\\
	
	XML download also allows to create backups of the quiz

\subsection{Implementation}
	We use the ElementTree library for XML parsing in Python.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Postgres Container - Runs PostgreSQL version 9.5
        \item Postgres Data Container - This container stores the postgres data files. This is a requirement of Docker containers to persist the database to the disk between runs of containers
        \item Redis Container - Runs redis version 3.2 (used as a cache and broker for celery)
        \item Web Container - This is a container created from scratch and has all the necessary web server related packages like nginx, django, nodejs, uwsgi etc.
	\end{itemize}
